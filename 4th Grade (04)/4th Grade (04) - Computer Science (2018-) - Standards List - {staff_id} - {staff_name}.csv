,"Ethical complications arise from the opportunities provided by computing. With the ease of sending and receiving copies of media on the Internet, in formats such as video, photos, and music, students consider the opportunities for unauthorized use, such as online piracy and disregard of copyrights.

,People communicate about their code to help others understand and use their programs. Explaining one's design choices gives others a better understanding of one's work. Students may explain their step-by-step process of creating a program in a presentation or demonstration of their personal code journals.

,"Collaborative computing is the process of creating computational artifacts by working in pairs or on teams. It involves asking for the contributions and feedback of others. Effective collaboration can often lead to better outcomes than working independently. With teacher guidance, students take turns in different roles during program development, such as driver, navigator, notetaker, facilitator, and debugger, as they design and implement their program.",Computer Science (2018-),Grade_04,3-5,,California,,https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/computerscicontentstds.asp

,"Programs do not always run properly. Students need to understand how to test and make necessary corrections to their programs to ensure they run properly. Students successfully identify and fix errors in (debug) their programs and programs created by others. Debugging strategies at this level may include testing to determine the first place the solution is in error and fixing accordingly, leaving ""breadcrumbs"" in a program, and soliciting assistance from peers and online resources. ",Computer Science (2018-),Grade_04,3-5,,California,,https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/computerscicontentstds.asp

,"Intellectual property rights can vary by country, but copyright laws give the creator of a work a set of rights and prevents others from copying the work and using it in ways that they may not like. Students consider common licenses that place limitations or restrictions on the use of others' work, such as images and music downloaded from the Internet. When incorporating the work of others, students attribute the work. At this level, students could give attribution by including credits or links directly in their programs, code comments, or separate project pages.",Computer Science (2018-),Grade_04,3-5,,California,,https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/computerscicontentstds.asp

,"Planning is an important part of the iterative process of program development. Students gain a basic understanding of the importance and process of planning before beginning to write code for a program. They plan the development of a program by outlining key features, time and resource constraints, and user expectations. Students should document the plan as, for example, a storyboard, flowchart, pseudocode, or story map. ",Computer Science (2018-),Grade_04,3-5,,California,,https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/computerscicontentstds.asp

,"Programs can be broken down into smaller parts, which can be incorporated into new or existing programs. Students incorporate predefined functions into their original designs. At this level, students do not need to understand all of the underlying implementation details of the abstractions that they use.

For example, students could use code from a ping pong animation to make a ball bounce in a new basketball game. They could also incorporate code from a single-player basketball game to create a two-player game with slightly different rules.",Computer Science (2018-),Grade_04,3-5,,California,,https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/computerscicontentstds.asp

,Control structures specify the order (sequence) in which instructions are executed within a program and can be combined to support the creation of more complex programs. Events allow portions of a program to run based on a specific action. Conditionals allow for the execution of a portion of code in a program when a certain condition is true. Loops allow for the repetition of a sequence of code multiple times. ,Computer Science (2018-),Grade_04,3-5,,California,,https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/computerscicontentstds.asp

,"The accuracy of data analysis is related to how the data is represented. Inferences or predictions based on data are less likely to be accurate if the data is insufficient, incomplete, or inaccurate or if the data is incorrect in some way. Additionally, people select aspects and subsets of data to be transformed, organized, and categorized. Students should be able to refer to data when communicating an idea, in order to highlight and/or propose relationships, predict outcomes, highlight different views and/or communicate insights and ideas.",Computer Science (2018-),Grade_04,3-5,,California,,https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/computerscicontentstds.asp

,"All saved data requires space to store it, whether locally or not (e.g., on the cloud). Music, images, video, and text require different amounts of storage. Video will often require more storage and different format than music or images alone because video combines both. The level of detail represented by that data also affects storage requirements. For instance, two pictures of the same object can require different amounts of storage based upon their resolution, and a high-resolution photo could require more storage than a low-resolution video. Students select appropriate storage for their data.",Computer Science (2018-),Grade_04,3-5,,California,,https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/computerscicontentstds.asp

,"Although computing systems vary, common troubleshooting strategies can be used across many different systems. Students use troubleshooting strategies to identify problems that could include a device not responding, lacking power, lacking a network connection, an app crashing, not playing sounds, or password entry not working. Students use and develop various solutions to address these problems. Solutions may include rebooting the device, checking for power, checking network availability, opening and closing an app, making sure speakers are turned on or headphones are plugged in, and making sure that the caps lock key is not on.",Computer Science (2018-),Grade_04,3-5,,California,,https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/computerscicontentstds.asp
